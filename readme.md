# Hi there, I'm Steven! 👋

## About Me
I'm an ditigal architect by day, recreational programmer by night. This github is my private github account, and is not used for any projects or products related to my work at AMIS Conclusion. 

🔭 I’m currently working on an agentic platform (actually more of an LLM infused data pipeline) . 

🌱 I’m learning Rust, to compliment the limitations of Python.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects and participate in (kaggle) competitions.
