# Hi there, I'm Steven by the way!

## About Me
I'm an digital architect by day, recreational programmer by night. This github is my private github account, and is not used for any projects or products related to my dayjob. 

 🔭  Currently working on an tool to generate consistent ArchiMate models. 
 
 🌱  Learning Rust, to compliment the limitations of Python and building my own (extremely niche) llm for the experience.
 
 🤝  Always looking to collaborate on innovative projects and participate in fun challenges.
