# Hi there, I'm Steven! 👋

## About Me
I'm an digital architect by day, recreational programmer by night. I live in Utrecht with my family and work at AMIS Conclusion as a consultant. This github is my private github account, and is not used for any projects or products related to my work at AMIS Conclusion. 

 🔭  Currently working on an KYC/AML platform for a customer and an internal productivity platform that uses llm infused data pipelines. 
 
 🌱  Learning Rust, to compliment the limitations of Python and building my own (extremely niche) llm for the experience.
 
 🤝  Always looking to collaborate on innovative projects and participate in (kaggle/algorithmic) competitions.
