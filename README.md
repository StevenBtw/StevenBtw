# Hi there! I'm Steven, by the way.

This is my personal GitHub for side projects and experiments. 

## About Me

💻 Recreational programmer. I code to learn and for fun, not for work.

🔭 Interested in data science, operations research, robotics, and (home) automation.

🌱 Mostly Python, learning Rust.

🔚 But enough About Me.


## Favorite Projects right now

⚡ **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** If you are still using pip, try this! UV is super fast, more feature-complete, and also check ruff (linter) and ty (type checker) from Astral.

🔁 **[Marimo](https://marimo.io/):** Next-gen Python notebooks that are reactive and interactive. Think of a modern Jupyter, but on steroids. 

🗺️ **[AutoMate](https://github.com/StevenBtw/AutoMate):** My own project for generating consistent ArchiMate models using knowledge graphs, heuristics, and AI.

🧬 **[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/):** Type-safe AI agent framework that doesn't bury you in unnecessary abstractions.

🧮 **[solvOR](https://github.com/StevenBtw/solvOR):** A side project that got out of hand. Optimization toolbox covering everything from simplex to simulated annealing, all in readable pure Python.
