🔚 But enough About Me.


## Favorite Projects right now

⚡ **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** If you are still using pip, try this! UV is super fast and very versatile. Also check their linter (ruff) and type checker (ty).

🗺️ **[Deriva](https://github.com/StevenBtw/deriva):** My own project for deriving consistent ArchiMate models using knowledge graphs, heuristics, and LLM's. 

🔁 **[Marimo](https://marimo.io/):** Next-gen Python notebooks that are reactive and interactive. Think of a modern Jupyter, but on steroids. 

🧬 **[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/):** Type-safe AI agent framework that doesn't bury you in unnecessary abstractions.
